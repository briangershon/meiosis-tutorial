# Playing with Meiosis pattern

"Meiosis is not a library. It's a simple pattern to manage state in your web applications."

"Think Redux, MobX, Cerebral, React Context, etc. but without having library imports everywhere and being tied to a framework API. Instead, just plain functions and objects."

This repo is my work as I ran through the tutorial using React: http://meiosis.js.org/tutorial/toc.html

Some changes I made:

  * Updated to ES6
  * Followed airbnb eslint
  * Used Parcel Bundler to build (compile jsx) and serve app

## How to run this locally

    npm install
    npm start
